A shower\n or bathtub, a plain white toilet, a bowl sink, and some storage, right?\n For decades, the American bathroom included these same, standard \nfeatures.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But <a href=\"https://www.totousa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TOTO USA</a>\n is here to show us all that the way we’ve been using our bathrooms is \nall wrong. In fact, many of us have no idea the amazing potential inside\n the four walls of a restroom.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><div><section class=\"content-part include-mask\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.housetipster.com/resize_908x1361/8a121fa8-ce61-4cc3-9e66-308cd52210a9.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" width=\"907\" height=\"1361\"><div class=\"mask-hover\"><span class=\"view\">view</span></div></section></div></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We met Bill Strang, President of \nOperations and eCommerce at TOTO USA before at the Greenbuild Expo in \nBoston, Massachusetts and we were pleased to see him again at the 2018 \nKitchen &amp; Bath Industry Show in Orlando, Florida. While at KBIS, he \nshowed us a few innovations TOTO is bringing to the market.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And boy, are we pumped about ‘em!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">About TOTO</h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why are we such big fans of TOTO? It’s \nhard to know where to start! The company, which started in Japan, is \nover 100 years old. It wasn’t until 1989 that TOTO crossed over into the\n US market.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><div><section class=\"content-part include-mask\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.housetipster.com/resize_908x605/987463a0-861c-4b65-bbe2-56a7edc711fc.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" width=\"907\" height=\"605\"><div class=\"mask-hover\"><span class=\"view\">view</span></div></section></div></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since then, TOTO has infused the \nbathroom fixture market with eco-friendly, user-friendly, and \ninnovation-friendly technologies that blend the art of Japanese pottery \nand porcelain-work with the specific needs of the Western market.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><div><section class=\"content-part include-mask\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.housetipster.com/resize_908x605/7855a178-d424-470d-9680-5bb92d0f7488.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" width=\"907\" height=\"605\"><div class=\"mask-hover\"><span class=\"view\">view</span></div></section></div></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This company checks every box: they are \nstewards of the environment, passionate about technology, and are \ndedicated to providing consumers a luxurious end-product.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">TOTO at KBIS</h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like many of his colleges spanning \nhundreds of companies and product lines, Bill raved about the 2018 KBIS \nshow. “We’ve had a great show so far this year,” he told us, further \nnoting that the amount of enthusiasm for TOTO’s products is “absolutely \nspectacular!”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the highlights of the TOTO USA booth here at KBIS was, hands down, the <a href=\"https://www.totousa.com/neorest-700h-dual-flush-toilet-10-and-08-gpf-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">NeoRest Toilet</a>. This combination toilet and full washlet provide the user the ultimate bathroom experience.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><div><section class=\"content-part include-mask\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.housetipster.com/resize_908x605/cecd859a-b577-4f50-bb36-645dd615907b.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" width=\"907\" height=\"605\"><div class=\"mask-hover\"><span class=\"view\">view</span></div></section></div></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Per Bill, “This product gives you the \npersonal cleanliness aspect, providing you a full rinse from front to \nback. Plus, it has a remote-controlled heated seat and built-in \ndeodorizer.” Buckle in; the NeoRest toilet experience doesn’t stop \nthere. The tornado-powered flush system effectively wipes the bowl clean\n with the sanitizing power of electrolyzed water. Less toilet-scrubbing \nsessions? Sign us up!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This particular toilet is quite popular \nin both the European and Japanese markets, and Bill expects it to make a\n big splash (no pun intended) here in the US.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another fun market introduction is the \nfreestanding Zero-Gravity Tub that does just what it says. Sure, it’s \nbeautiful in and of itself, but the tub also gives the bather a feeling \nof weightlessness! “We designed the ergonomics of the bathtub to give \nyour knees, hips, elbows, and shoulders the natural conditions of \nweightlessness. You actually feel like you’re floating in space.” As an \nadded bonus, Bill explained that the tub includes a jet “neck pillow” \nthat runs hot water directly behind your neck.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, does it work? According to Bill, \nscience backs up this design. “We’ve done brain wave scans to analyze \nthe zen-like experience you have when you sit in this tub. It helps you \nget into a meditative state.”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wow. Just, wow.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Future of the Bathroom is TOTO USA</h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">TOTO USA plans to continue looking for innovation in engineering, so stay tuned for what they have in store in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><div><section class=\"content-part include-mask\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin: 0px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn3.housetipster.com/resize_908x605/76af5ec4-240f-4857-abb0-158dcf56082a.jpg\" style=\"float: none; margin: 0px;\" width=\"907\" height=\"605\"><div class=\"mask-hover\"><span class=\"view\">view</span></div></section></div></div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before you start searching for TOTO products (available at<a href=\"https://www.totousa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> online retailers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.totousa.com/find-a-showroom\" rel=\"nofollow\">wholesalers nationwide</a>), we’ll leave you with this final thought from Bill: “I promise you, if you begin to use a washlet, it’ll change your life.”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After seeing these products firsthand, we don’t doubt it!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Bill, thank you for your energy, enthusiasm, and passion for amazing bathroom fixtures! </em></p>\n</div>",
